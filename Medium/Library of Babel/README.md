## Description

Concept: You cant think of anything that dosent already exist in the library of babel :P
 For any text data (under 3200 chars), the data will remain in the exact location in the library all the time. The library has hexes, walls, shelves, volumes, books and page number as location which will be the same for any combination of characters. All information is stored.



## Solution

1. We give a riddle with an image above it.
2. Riddle will tell you that you have to **use the library of babel**.
3. The riddle will contain the location (hex) which can be put in the library,which will result in the word "metadata".
4. The image has hidden metadata, which will contain the location(hex).
5. Use the location and decode again, the resulting text will be the answer to the riddle.
6. **cryptichunttwentytwo** is the final answer.
