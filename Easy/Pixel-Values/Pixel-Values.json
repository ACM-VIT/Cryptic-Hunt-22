            "description": "We were finally able to procure a very rare photo of schrodinger's cat. Sadly, it's been tampered with. A person named Chase, who is 64 years old, released this photo, alongwith two encoded coordinates, x = MjM0, y = MTYy. He also released a statement saying, 'Always think positive'. The last part of schrodinger's superior equation is hidden in the image, which will be able to infinitely generate new colours. A 6 digit code to be obtained from the photo using these coordinates is the solution to this mystery.",
