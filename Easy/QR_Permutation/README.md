Category: Easy
Mode: Online
Authors: Manav, Saharsh
Points: TBD

Entry Point: 16 images, 2 blurred images(final answer)

Description

We take a background image, divide it into sixteen parts and then jumble them. Then we put two QR codes on sets of eight jumbled images and divide and shuffle them again.
The player will receive a canva link which will lead them to a template with the images.

Solution
They have to rearrange to retrieve the two QR codes back. They scan the QRs to obtain two images which are the final answer. The two images will also be blurred and given
as a clue to the player along with the 16 images.
