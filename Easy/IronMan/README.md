## Specifications

### Entry point: 
The user will be given a hex code 

`45 4E 4B 4A 20 49 57 4A 20 45 4F 20 53 57 50 59 44 45 4A 43 20 49 41`

### Requirement: 
QR Code Scanner

### Reward: 
TBD (Usually a clue to another question)

## Description

This question will have multiple sub-questions. 

1) The user will be given this Hex Code

`45 4E 4B 4A 20 49 57 4A 20 45 4F 20 53 57 50 59 44 45 4A 43 20 49 41`

2) The user will have to convert the code to text

3) This will be the output:

`ENKJ IWJ EO SWPYDEJC IA`

4) The user will be asked this question:

`What's something in common between George Orwell and VIT?`

(Add the digits of the number until you arrive to a single digit)

5) 1984 (VIT was found in 1984, which is also a novel by George Orwell)

6) Add each digit of the number until its a single digit

7) a. 1+9+8+4=22

   b. 2+2=4

8) 4 will be the key to the caeser cipher which is to be used to crack the above code.

`Caesar Cipher
Key = 4`

9) ENKJ IWJ EO SWPYDEJC IA will give:
