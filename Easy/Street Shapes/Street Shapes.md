Description

You start with a white screen, with 4 random shapes and 3 hints.
Only one of them is the correct answer - YOU ONLY GET ONE CHANCE TO CLICK ON THE CORRECT SHAPE SO REALLY ANALYSE THE HINTS FIRST

The hints all refer to certain names about people. These hints point to roads in MH - VIT - Planck (hint - plancks equation) - Kissinger (hint - the chair of the 9/11 commission who won the noble peace prize) - Baltimore (the birthplace of the us national anthem)
They seem like a random collection of words- they have to figure out they refer to specific roads in VIT
Once they figure that out, they have to go to google maps and when they ckeck the roads, they trace one of the shapes given in the question
