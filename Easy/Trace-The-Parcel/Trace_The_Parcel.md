Description

After solving the Iron Man question, the player encounters a box with an invoice attached to it. The player scans the qr code on the invoice. Using the information in the invoice, they must trace the origin of the parcel(Amazon delivery spot).

Solution
1.	Player scans the QR code on the box.
2.	It displays a congraulatory message for solving the Iron Man question as follows:
    "Congratulations you've earned x points. To earn more trace the parcel." 
3.	Below this message will be a blurred picture of bala(ayushman khurana) which will lead them to balaji.
4.	 At balaji they scan another qr code which gives them a photo of Ted Mosby and Room 301,
which should lead them to the architecture block. When they reach 301, they'll have to scan a QR code, that opens the rickroll video. They'll have to watch it till the end to get the final answer which is "go to the next room." There they'll find another QR Code which upon scanning awards them with points.
