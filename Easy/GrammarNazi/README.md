Description

Grammar Nazis commit social atrocities,
But for some points, these people you do have to please.
Your pride will be hurt,
But with one correction that they blurt,
You shall get the tea,
And points will be added to your identity.

'events.gravitas.registration -- or whatever the receipt link is'

The small sighs flow by
Eat up your nights, oh my
Ah, curious cats
