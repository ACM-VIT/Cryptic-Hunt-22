## Description

This question revolves around interaction with a discord bot, which leads to a youtube video that contains a morse code. When decoded, the morse code provides the reward. (Insert the reasoning behind the clues and rewards provided, and detail the bot's behaviour to different inputs)

## Solution

1. App gives `<clue>` to the user 
2. When `<clue>` is decoded, provides the discord server link, bot's user account, and the slash command required to interact with the bot on discord (Maybe even let users dm the bot without using the hidden slash command on the server)
3. On using the right slash command (or dm'ing the right message to the bot), the bot provides `<riddle>`
4. On solving and replying to the bot with the right answer to `<riddle>`, the bot provides the youtube video link
5. Solving the youtube video link provides the user with the reward (Either the morse code is the reward, or the app takes the decoded string and provides the reward)
