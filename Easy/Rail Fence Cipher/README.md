* **Points:** TBD

## Specifications

* **Entry point:** An image with a picture of a train(supposedly 'rail') with encrypted text on the foreground is given

* **Reward:** Decrypting the 'Rail-Fence' Cipher will lead to the answer

## Description

Encrypted text on an image is given (Rail-Fence Cipher), a direct questions which involves decrypting the cipher.

## Solution

1. An image with encrypted text on the foreground is provided
2. The text can be typed into sites or online tools like https://www.dcode.fr/rail-fence-cipher to be decrypted.
3. Solution must be inputted into a text field

## Hints:

 - Use Rail-Fence Cipher
 - Since it is an algorithm try using an online tool/decrypter
