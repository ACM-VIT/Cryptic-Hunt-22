Here they come the business men
Like a herd of cattle rumbling in
The exchange has officially begun
Now all the offices are buzzing
The executives are busy bee's
The watch it keeps turning in the employee's
And they just turn, smile, shift, repeat
Turn, smile, shift, repeat
There's a crowd for men on Wall Street
Near the tallest building on the block
The suit has lost his fortune to the stocks
There was no time to see his fatal flaw
The madness set in with the loss
Now he cuts their throats to watch their heads fall off
And they just turn, smile, shift, repeat
Turn, smile, shift, repeat
Turn, smile, shift, repeat
Turn, smile, shift, repeat
And decimal points and dollar signs and taxes, penalties, and fines
He's come to cut you down
Ohhh, and numbers, passwords, protocol
It's not enough to save your soul
He's come to cut you down
Bring you right back to zero
And they just turn, smile, shift, repeat
Turn, smile, shift, repeat
Turn, smile, shift, repeat
Turn, smile, shift, repeat
And decimal points and dollar signs and taxes, penalties, and fines
He's come to cut you down
Ohhh, and numbers, passwords, protocol
It's not enough to save your soul
He's come to cut you down
Bring you right back to zero
