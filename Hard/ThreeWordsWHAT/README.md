## Description

Here's a map of VIT, with the path of an interpid explorer mapped out on it. However, their way of navigation is absurd and they've found an unconventional way to map their journey, in three words, its "simple, stupefying and suuuuuuper long". Follow in the footsteps of this explorer, aided by the pictures taken by them.


## Solution

1. We give the map of the campus with the path mapped out.
2. We also provide a portrait photo of the view from that location (photo in day/night).
3. Their job is to find the location, with the what3words mapping system.
4. They repeat that for all the locations listed in the map and collect all the words.
5. The final answer is all these collected words arranged in reverse alphabetical order.
6. Total locations: 7

## Hints:

 - Hint 1 
    - Give a picture of the place in full panorama.
 - Hint 2 
    - Give a picture of the grid overlayed over the map, with one box highlighted in white border with a "///" in red inside it.

## Notes:
 - For easy - question group with each location giving partial points
 - For hard - all the location phrases have to be found, and the answer will be a comma separated list of all words arranged in descending order.
