## Description

The crux of the question lies in the Shamir Secret Sharing Algorithm. The idea is to share a secret among a group of people, and only one person can reconstruct the secret.

The secret is reconstructed by adding up all the shares, with a threshold of the number of shares required to reconstruct the secret.
