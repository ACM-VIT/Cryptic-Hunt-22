## Description

(Flowers have a mystery that has captivated writers from across the centuries. But did you know they had much more to tell us?
Given below are some facts relating to certain flowers. Figure out which flowers these are and find these beauties on campus. You'll find the answer to your emotional and treasure woes there.)

Campus is divided into 3 sectors: 
- main gate to dc
- dc to c and d block
- c and d block to mgb

Dew laden, the little petals are weighed down
Sometimes they precurse a smile, or maybe a frown
Silent secrets, these beauties hide,
In them, your points we confide.
Find where they lay
And as you enjoy their sight, you continue to play.


## Solution

1. F1: 
   Prettier petals than a rose, the pride of Barbados.
   Poisonous pellets we hold for those who consume
   Seeing our Royal Merit, the other flowers fume.
   - Caesalpinia pulcherrima - peacock flower - KC Garden - sector 1

2. F2:
   The beautiful prince Nero's face does frown,
   Whatever you say, the flower does take his crown.
   What we produce is bitter, some say alkaline,
   Let's have some fun, one of them is ibogamine.
   - Pinwheelflower - Opposite PRP, SJT - Sector 3

3. F3:
   The beautiful starcluster, 
   Seen from the pyramids, 
   it leaves me in a bluster.
   Bright red, in full bloom, they seem madder
   But in butterfly gardens, you're awed and gladder
   - Pentas lanceolata - near the optical store - sector 2 

4. F4:
   The fabulous flower, creepier than the foxglove
   The progenitor of digitalis, we give your heart a shove
   The one that feeds the butterflies
   The one who has us, freely sighs.
   - Ganges primrose - Main entrance fountain - sector 1

5. F5:
   In the barren lands it grows,
   So good, holier than the rose.
   The venom they carry, in arrows it flies
   Hunting animals or fish, for the food to suffice
   - Adenium obesum - Near SJT - sector 3
