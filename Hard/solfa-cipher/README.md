* **Requirements:** webpage, image of rotatory deoder, key to hill cipher, image of hill, audio file

## Description 

The player will be given an image of a WW2 rotatory decoder and a background image of a hill. The player will use hill cipher to decrypt the first hint. Next they get a link to a gdrive from where they will decrypt an audio file using solfa cipher.

## Solution

1. The link takes you to a website where the image of a WW2 rotatory decoder with a background image of a **hill** has been provided.
2. The bars of the decoder have hints (three words encrypted in **hill** cipher). 
3. The key `VCIF` for the cipher will be found on inspecting the website. 
4. This key must be converted to its numerical equivalent 2x2 matrix `22 3 9 6`.
5. The website also has a hidden authentication button which when clicked on will ask for the three decoded words. 
6. The correct answer leads to another page.
7. This page will provide a [link to a gdrive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IRzD9rLdqBdGDX-UmfHYMD9smHM2V5ox?usp=sharing) containing an audio file and a pdf with musical notations for the same.
8. The audio file is decrypted using solfa cipher and the default solfa key.
9. The `value` got is entered into the website.
10. The same `value` will be entered into the website.

The answer is `expecttheunexpected`.
