## Description 

The player will be given an image of a WW2 rotatory decoder and a background image of a hill. The player will use hill cipher to decrypt the first hint. Next they get a zipped audio file that must be decrypted using solfa cipher and then a shift cipher.

## Solution

1. The link takes you to a website where the image of a WW2 rotatory decoder with a background image of a `hill` has been provided.
2. The bars of the decoder have hints (three words encrypted in `hill` cipher). 
3. The key for the cipher will be found on inspecting the website.
4. The website also has a hidden authentication button which will ask for the three decoded words and leads to another page.
5. A `.7z` zipped file would be provided which consists of a audio file and a key.
6. The audio file is decrypted using solfa cipher and the key provided in the zip file.
7. The value got is decrypted using shift cipher with a key `7`. 

The decrypted word gives the next clue.
